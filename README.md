Water Potability prediction,
Access to clean and safe drinking water is not only essential for maintaining good health, but it is also a fundamental human right. It plays a crucial role in well-designed health protection strategies. Testing water samples from different regions is crucial as the world is facing the impending problem of water scarcity. Many factories dispose of their industrial waste into water bodies that serve as sources of water for many cities. If the water is not drinkable, it can lead to numerous chronic diseases and even death. To address this issue, we can develop a software system that takes in the chemical composition inputs and provides a score indicating whether the water sample is potable or not.
