# 💧 Water Potability Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
The Water Potability Analysis project is designed to determine whether water is safe for consumption based on its physicochemical properties. It uses machine learning models to analyze water quality data and predict potability, aiding in decision-making processes for water safety assessments.

## ✨ Key Features
1. 📊 **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**  
   - 📂 Analyze water quality datasets with features like pH, hardness, and chemical content.  
   - 🔍 Handle missing data through imputation and normalization techniques.  

2. 📈 **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - ⚙️ Implement machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.  
   - 📉 Evaluate model performance with MSE, RMSE, r2_score , median_absolute_error 

3. 📖 **Visualization Tools**  
   - 📊 Generate data distribution graphs and correlation heatmaps.  
   - 🗺️ Visualize decision boundaries and predictions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: 🐍 Python  
- **Data Visualization**: 📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 🤖 Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  

## 📖 Usage
1. 📂 Load the dataset file (CSV format).  
2. 🧪 View data analysis and visualizations.  
3. 🚀 Run predictions to assess water potability.  

## 📋 Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Score**: score = max(0, 100 * (1 - median_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))) 
 

## 📋 Output Format
- **Predictions**: ✅ Safe or 🚫 Unsafe classification for water samples from certain range of potability.  
- **Visualizations**: 📈 Graphs and heatmaps for data insights.  

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
- 🌍 Support for larger datasets and real-time streaming data.  
- 🤖 Integration with advanced AI models for better predictions.
